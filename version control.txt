With regard to the Version control system, we can just find a suitable plugin instead. Doing this should make things easier and make
things go a lot faster.

Some of the plugins I've looked at are:

VersionPress
GitHub(a bit complicated though) 
Wp Rollback
Bedrock 

We can simply google to see which is best suited for us and which is the easiest for all of us to understand.
